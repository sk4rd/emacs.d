#+title: Sk4rd's Emacs Configuration
#+options: num:nil toc:nil
#+property: header-args :results silent

This is my personal emacs configuration inside of an org file. I use
this config mostly for school but also for programming and daily notes
in general.

[[file:.screenshots/emacs-screenshot.png]]

* Installation
You can install this configuration by copying =init.el= and
=early-init.el= to the default emacs directory.
#+begin_src sh
  cp ./emacs.d/init.el ./emacs.d/early-init.el ~/.emacs.d/
#+end_src

** Alternative approach
Alternatively, you can use the org file directly by specifiying it's
load path in your own =init.el=.

Start by copying =README.org= into your default emacs directory.
#+begin_src sh
  cp ./emacs.d/README.org ~/.emacs.d/
#+end_src

Then you need to put the following into your =init.el=.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
  (require 'org)
  (org-babel-load-file
   (expand-file-name "README.org"
		     user-emacs-directory))
#+end_src

** Dependencies
You need to install the =FantasqueSansMono Nerd Font= to display the
correct font.

Remember to also install the missing icons by running =M-x
all-the-icons-install-fonts=, upon your first emacs launch.

* Package Management

** package.el
First of all we have to disable =package.el=, the default Emacs
package manager, in order to use an alternative called [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]]. It
needs to be disabled before anything else so it will be put into the
=early-init.el= file.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle early-init.el
  ;; Disable Emacs's default package manager
  (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
#+end_src

** straight.el
After disabling emacs's default package manager, we can proceed to
install [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]]. It is a package manager for emacs which directly
clones the remote git repository and builds it for you. It has good
[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] integration.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Install and bootstrap straight.el
  (defvar bootstrap-version)
  (let ((bootstrap-file
	 (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
	(bootstrap-version 6))
    (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
      (with-current-buffer
	  (url-retrieve-synchronously
	   "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radian-software/straight.el/develop/install.el"
	   'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
	(goto-char (point-max))
	(eval-print-last-sexp)))
    (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
#+end_src

** use-package
We can also enable the [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] macro which provides us with a
convenient syntax to configure emacs. Since we already added
[[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]] we can easily integrate it. I also want [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] to use
sources from straight by default.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Install use-package using straight.el
  (straight-use-package 'use-package)
  ;; Configure use-package to use straight.el by default
  (use-package straight
    :custom
    (straight-use-package-by-default t))
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+end_src

* User Interface
Below are all code snippets regarding the customization of the
graphical user interface.

** Font
I like to use the [[https://www.programmingfonts.org/#fantasque-sans][Fantasque Sans Mono]] nerd font.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Set the default font
  (set-frame-font "FantasqueSansM Nerd Font Mono-11" nil t)
#+end_src

** GUI
Remove all the annoying bars and window decorations that are around
the emacs buffer.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Remove annoying GUI elements
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+end_src

** Theme
I use the gruvbox theme from the [[https://github.com/doomemacs/themes][doom emacs theme collection]].
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  (use-package doom-themes
    :config
    ;; Global settings (defaults)
    (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t    ; if nil, bold is universally disabled
	  doom-themes-enable-italic t) ; if nil, italics is universally disabled
    (load-theme 'doom-gruvbox t)
    ;; Enable flashing mode-line on errors
    (doom-themes-visual-bell-config)
    ;; Corrects (and improves) org-mode's native fontification.
    (doom-themes-org-config))
#+end_src

** org-bullets
I want the bullet points in org-mode to look and be sized,
differently. Therefore I use [[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][org-bullets]] to change them.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Show org-mode bullets as UTF-8 charactersx
  (use-package org-bullets
    :custom
    (org-bullets-bullet-list '("▸" "■" "◈" "◉" "◊"))
    :config
    (custom-set-faces
     '(org-level-1 ((t (:inherit outline-1 :height 2.0))))
     '(org-level-2 ((t (:inherit outline-2 :height 1.5))))
     '(org-level-3 ((t (:inherit outline-3 :height 1.2))))
     '(org-level-4 ((t (:inherit outline-4 :height 1.0))))
     '(org-level-5 ((t (:inherit outline-5 :height 1.0)))))
    (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1))))
#+end_src

* Packages
** magit
[[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] enables git integration inside of emacs. You can open the main
menu of [[https://github.com/magit/magit][magit]] inside a project with a =.git= directory.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  (use-package magit
    :bind
    ("C-x g" . magit-status)
    ("C-x M-g" . magit-dispatch)
    ("C-c M-g" . magit-file-dispatch))
#+end_src

** org-mode
[[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] is a major mode which is perhaps the most powerful feature of
emacs. It allows you to take notes, organize yourself, compile
documents to different formats (like pandoc), execute code blocks and
even more.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Configure org-mode and it's sub functions
  (use-package org
    :straight (:type built-in)
    :bind ("C-c a" . org-agenda)
    :custom
    (org-attach-use-inheritance t)
    :config
    ;; Add my notes to the org-agenda
    (defun org-agenda-files (&rest _)
      (directory-files-recursively "~/docs/notes" org-agenda-file-regexp)))
#+end_src

** project
[[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/progmodes/project.el][project.el]] helps with quickly accessing your projects which are
initialized with git. It is now included with Emacs 29 by default.
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package project
    :straight (:type built-in)
    :config
    (project-remember-projects-under "~/docs/projects" t))
#+end_src

** org-roam
[[https://www.orgroam.com/][Org roam]] is a 'plain-text personal knowledge management system' which
allows you to make notes and connect them like neurons inside of your
brain, except it's using org IDs. The notes should be atomic (about
one topic only and they should fit on one page), just like in the
note-taking method called [[https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/][Zettelkasten]].
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  ;; Install and configure org-roam
  ;; for personal notes and school
  (use-package org-roam
    :after org
    :init
    (setq org-roam-v2-ack t)
    :custom
    (org-roam-directory "~/docs/notes/")
    (org-roam-completion-everywhere t)
    (org-roam-dailies-capture-templates
     '(("d" "default" entry "* %<%I:%M %p>: %?"
	:if-new (file+head "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org" "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n"))))
    :bind (("C-c n l" . org-roam-buffer-toggle)
	   ("C-c n f" . org-roam-node-find)
	   ("C-c n i" . org-roam-node-insert)
	   :map org-mode-map
	   ("C-M-i" . completion-at-point)
	   :map org-roam-dailies-map
	   ("Y" . org-roam-dailies-capture-yesterday)
	   ("T" . org-roam-dailies-capture-tomorrow))
    :bind-keymap
    ("C-c n d" . org-roam-dailies-map)
    :config
    (require 'org-roam-dailies) ;; Ensure the keymap is available
    (org-roam-db-autosync-mode))
#+end_src

** org-roam-ui
Visualizing notes is a key concept I like to follow in learning. I use
[[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][org-roam-ui]] to view my notes as a kind of 'neural network' in my
browser. It spawns an http server inside of emacs and opens it in your
default browser.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  (use-package org-roam-ui
    :straight
      (:host github :repo "org-roam/org-roam-ui" :branch "main" :files ("*.el" "out"))
      :after org-roam
      :config
      (setq org-roam-ui-sync-theme t
	    org-roam-ui-follow t
	    org-roam-ui-update-on-save t
	    org-roam-ui-open-on-start t))
#+end_src

** all-the-icons
[[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][All the icons]] is a helper package for emacs which installs icon fonts
for you. Some packages in this config use all-the-icons so we need to
download it and set it up.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  (use-package all-the-icons)
#+end_src

You will need to run =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts=, in order to
install all the missing fonts.

** all-the-icons-dired
[[https://github.com/jtbm37/all-the-icons-dired][all-the-icons-dired]] is a package which adds fancy icons from
[[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all-the-icons]] to dired-mode.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  (use-package all-the-icons-dired
    :hook (dired-mode . (lambda ()
			  (interactive)
			  (unless (file-remote-p default-directory)
			    (all-the-icons-dired-mode)))))
#+end_src

** dired-subtree
[[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks/tree/master][This package]] lets you view the underlying contents of a directory
inside of dired-mode.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  (use-package dired-subtree
    :config
    (advice-add 'dired-subtree-toggle :after (lambda ()
					       (interactive)
					       (when all-the-icons-dired-mode
						 (revert-buffer))))
    (bind-key "<tab>" #'dired-subtree-toggle dired-mode-map))
#+end_src

** which-key
[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][Which key]] is a minor mode for emacs which displays a buffer with the
/following/ keybindings, after starting a key sequence.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  (use-package which-key
    :config
    (which-key-setup-minibuffer)
    (which-key-mode))
#+end_src

** helm-mode
[[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm mode]] is an auto completion layer for emacs searches. I find it
very useful.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
  (use-package helm
    :config (helm-mode))
#+end_src

* Misc
** Backup and Autosave files
Emacs leaves some files around and 'contaminates' the directories
being worked on. I don't like this behavior, so we just move these
files into subdirs in the main emacs directory.
#+begin_src elisp :tangle early-init.el
  ;; Move backup and autosave files to
  ;; their respective subdirectories
  (setq backup-directory-alist
	`((".*" . ,"~/.emacs.d/backups")))
  (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms
	`((".*" ,"~/.emacs.d/auto-saves" t)))
  ;; Set the auto save timeout interval to a lower value
  (setq auto-save-timeout 10
	auto-save-interval 150)
#+end_src
